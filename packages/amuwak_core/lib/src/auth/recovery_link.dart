/// verifier and stores it in *that browser's* localStorage; the `?code=` in
/// the email can only be exchanged against it. Request the reset on a laptop
/// and open the mail on a phone — or in an email client's isolated in-app
/// browser — and the exchange has nothing to work with. A token hash carries
/// its own proof, so [AuthService.verifyRecoveryToken] needs no local state.
///
/// Call this once, from bootstrap, before the first frame: `verifyOTP` raises
/// `passwordRecovery` and both apps' gates seed from that event. It reaches
/// them even though it fires before they mount, because GoTrue's
/// `onAuthStateChange` is a `BehaviorSubject` and replays its last event to a
/// new subscriber.
///
/// Deliberately inert for every other link shape. `?code=` belongs to
/// supabase_flutter's deeplink observer and the code can only be spent once,
/// so racing it here would break the flow this is meant to widen. A token hash
/// of some other `type` — signup confirmation, email change — is likewise not
/// ours; redeeming one as a recovery would drop the user on a
/// set-a-new-password screen they never asked for.
